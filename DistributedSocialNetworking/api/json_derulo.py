# Key for the Request Factories
#
# Appending .json() to the end of these gets the json
# or you can store it and get the status_code
#
# eg/ request = FriendRequestFactory(node.host)
#     response = request.post(author, friend)
#     if response.status_code != 200:
#          explode()
#     data = response.json()
#
# FriendRequestFactory(node.host).post(author, friend)  # Pass in the author objects, not the UUID
# VisiblePostsRequestFactory(node.host).get(uuid)   # All posts visible to UUID
# PublicPostsRequestFactory(node.host).get()        # All public posts
# AuthoredPostsRequestFactory(node.host).get(requester_uuid, author_uuid) # Author's posts visible to Requester
# FriendQueryRequestFactory(node.host).get(author1_uuid, author2_uuid)
